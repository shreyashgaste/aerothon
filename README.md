# Aircraft Sustainability Platform

## Problem Statement
The aviation industry is a significant contributor to global emissions, and it is becoming increasingly important to reduce its carbon footprint. One of the ways to achieve this goal is to repurpose and recycle end-of-life aircraft components. However, the process of connecting aircraft manufacturers, airlines, and recycling facilities can be time-consuming and inefficient. Therefore, there is a need for a platform that facilitates this process.

## Solution
We propose a platform that connects aircraft manufacturers, airlines, and recycling facilities to facilitate the repurposing and recycling of end-of-life aircraft components. The platform will enable aircraft manufacturers and airlines to list their end-of-life components, and recycling facilities can bid on them. The platform will also provide a communication channel for all the parties involved to discuss the logistics of transporting the components to the recycling facilities.

## Tech Stack
* React.js
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB

## Features
* User authentication and authorization
* Dashboard for aircraft manufacturers and airlines to list their end-of-life components
* Search and filtering capabilities for recycling facilities to find suitable components
* Bidding system for recycling facilities to bid on the listed components

## Conclusion
The Aircraft Components Repurposing and Recycling Platform is an innovative solution that can help reduce the aviation industry's carbon footprint. With its user-friendly interface and robust features, the platform can streamline the process of repurposing and recycling end-of-life aircraft components.
